## To generate new json files for mocks

First create the French version of the mock.
Note: fill the inputs as requested by the example jsonc file.
```
use @example_XXXX and create the new json inside the `speaking/` folder. Here are the inputs:
1. fr
2.
3.
4.
```

Then translate the json to german (de).
```
okay, now create the `de` version of it. translate it to german (de). also for answer/audio id use de_ instead of fr_. 
A2-B1 german level. so keep things simple. no complex grammar. use tenses similar to french.
```

Then verify the generated json files.
```
verify the language (french) in @XXXXX and german in @YYYYY. only in sections `sampleAnswer` and `prompt`.
only tell me if there are (grammar/ context) errors. ignore warnings. for A2-B1 users.
```

## To generate A1 images

```
Generate a line art sketch for the following situation:

A women (facing to the camera) is sitting in front of a desk, reading a broucher that has appartment advertisements. 
She is taking a call on her mobile phone. Right hand is holding the phone to her ear, left hand is on the broucher.
In a bubble, we can see a well dressed man answering the phone (to show she is calling to someone). He is holding a file in the other hand. He is sitting in front of a house, with a tree next to it.

The objects we add should be easy to describe (this image will be used for a conversation, for language beginners (A1-B1)).

```

## To generate dialogue images

```
i want to generate a new image similar to attached images (black and white line art sketch with minimal details).
situation: "a women cashier is behind the counter. the male customer has a wine bottle in the hand. "
think of a supermarket cashier. a small PoS machine in side. but no other people in the scene. minimalistic, compact image.
add two bubbles (one for each person, as in the example images), but without disturbing the core details of the image. 


This is the scene 1. so use this image as reference (keep the same characters/ scene).
Now I want to create the 2nd scene: the women has the wine bottle on her counter. the customer is showing an id card. 

keep the above image as reference (keep the same characters/ scene).
Now, the customer is handing over the cash (show a CHF 10 note).

keep the above image as reference (keep the same characters/ scene).
cashier is passing the receipt. the receipt is on the desk, but top part is still under her hand.
```
