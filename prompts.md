# Usefull prompts

## To generate new json files for mocks

First create the French version of the mock.
Note: fill the inputs as requested by the example jsonc file.
```
use @example_XXXX and create the new json in the same loction. Here are the inputs:
1. fr
2.
3.
4.
```

Then translate the json to german (de).
```
okay, now create the `de` version of it. translate it to german (de). also for answer/audio id use de_ instead of fr_. 
A2-B1 german level. so keep things simple. no complex grammar. use tenses similar to french.
```

Then verify the generated json files.
```
verify the language (french) in @XXXXX and german in @YYYYY. only in sections `sampleAnswer` and `prompt`.
only tell me if there are (grammar/ context) errors. ignore warnings. for A2-B1 users.
```
